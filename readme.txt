Its all about Unicode!

== Description ==

PashtoFonts enables you to display Unicode Pashto in 42 web-based fonts without installing in client machine. PashtoFonts works same as Google font does, to provide various beautiful and decent fonts for web-developers to use in websites and online applications. 

Unfortunately Google font lack of Unicode fonts such as for Arabic, Persian, Urdu & Pashto. To insure the availability of these fonts we have integrated 42 most usable and decent PashtoFonts here. After installation the plugin will set a default font for your posts and pages. 

You can manage them later according to your choice. To provide such features for Urdu bloggers we have Nafees Urdu font integrated in this plugin. The plugin uses the external CSS library from PashtoFont website. 

The project is developed by Pukhtoogle.com as part of Pashto localization.
